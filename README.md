#Hello-Piston

##What is it?
At the moment.. pong! W/S for the left paddle to move, Up/Down for the right paddle

##Why is it?
To prepare myself for [#1GAM](http://www.onegameamonth.com/), and to sharpen my Rust skills in general! This repo is 
meant for a shallow and wide exploration of current rust gamedev libraries and practices (GFX, ECS, Input, Sound, Networking,
Persistence, Deployment, etc) by use of simple example.

A rambling wishlist of stuff to touch:
- [x] Piston Glutin Window
- [x] Piston 2D Graphics
- [x] Specs ECS
- [x] Audio
- [ ] AI
- [ ] Event bus
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Cross-Compilation
- [ ] Saving/Loading
- [ ] Menu/UI
- [ ] Debugging (hotswap/replay)
